# Company Web App
* How to run this application
    * You will need to run npm install for the dependencies.
    * In order to build a local server you will need to run ng serve --open(opens it in the browser for you). This will allow you to see what the web app looks like.
*  This web app gets information about different companies' orders and the employees' who are going to fulfill them. It also shows you the employees' emails and the deadline for the order to be fulfilled. The app comes built with a toggle button which lets you look at orders from the earliest deadline to the last or from the latest deadline to the earliest. The final feature that is built-in is the filter feature which allows you to filter through the employees by name to see orders that are being fulfilled by certain people.
